#Skip List Set Project
A Java implementation of SortedSet using a genericized Skip List data structure. This class provides logarithmic time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search operations while maintaining elements in sorted order.

##Features
Efficient insertion, deletion, and search.
Supports generic types.
Implements Java's SortedSet interface.
Dynamically adjusts height for probabilistic balancing. 

##Test Harness
The project includes a test file that compares runtimes against LinkedList and TreeSet. Performance tests are done with random integers, doubles, and strings for all 3 operations.
